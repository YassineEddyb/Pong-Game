# Pong-Game

this is a little pong game in JavaScript,
i used HTML5 canvas and ES6 classes,
i also created a little Robot that palys the game without losing
To create this robot i kept tracking the x axis of the ball when it's y axis is big then halp of the canvas 
then i maked the paddle move depend on x axis of the ball
and when the paddle hit's the ball it returns to the centre of the canvas
