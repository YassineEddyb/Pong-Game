# Pong-Game

This is a simple pong game in JavaScript,
I used HTML5 canvas and ES6 classes,
and also created a little Robot that plays the game without losing.
To create this robot I kept track of the x axis of the ball when it's y axis is bigger then half of the canvas.
then I maked the paddle move depending on x axis of the ball
and when the paddle hits the ball it returns to the center of the canvas.
